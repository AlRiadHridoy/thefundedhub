                  Futures and FX trading are not suitable for all investors.
                </div>
                An investor may lose all or part of their initial investment.
                Trading should only be done with risk capital—money that can be
                lost without endangering one&apos;s financial stability or
                lifestyle. This is not a solicitation or offer to buy or sell
                futures, options, or forex. Past performance does not guarantee
                future results.

                There are some restrictions under CFTC Rule 4.41 - Hypothetical
                or simulated performance outcomes Simulated outcomes do not
                represent actual trading. Because the deals were not actually
                performed, the outcomes may have under-or over-compensated for
                market conditions like lack of liquidity. Simulated trading
                programs are generally created with the advantage of hindsight.

                appetite. You could lose more than your initial investment, so
                don&apos;t deposit anything you can&apos;t afford to lose.
                Understand the hazards and take precautions to manage them.
