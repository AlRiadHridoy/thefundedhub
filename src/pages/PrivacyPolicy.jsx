                We need to process your personal data in order to offer you our
                services, i.e. to give you appropriate access, tools, and
                assistance, and to conduct transactions. As a rule of thumb, the
                following should be followed:
              </p>

              <p>
                Personal data includes name, address, phone number, email
                address, payment information, information about how the service
                is used, information about simulated transactions, and
                information from social media profiles that you choose to link
                to your account on the website. <br />
                Legitimate interest or fulfillment of a contract under which we
                provide our services are both sufficient legal grounds for
                processing. We retain your personal information for a short
                amount of time after we no longer provide you with services. The
                processing is necessary to preserve and defend our rights, which
                are based on our legitimate interests.

                you have given us your permission. To make it easy for you to
                discontinue receiving business communications, each email
                received will be clearly labelled as business communication and
                include a link that allows you to do so. As a rule of thumb, the
                following should be followed:

                agree to allow us to use your personal data for marketing
                reasons, we will do so.
